description: The hosts discuss Erik's working in the U.S. and heading back to Spain, as well Dennis painting as painting a deck. They also delve into the recent passing of a friend named Roger and Dennis' upcoming trip to Denver for his memorial. The conversation shifts to Dennis' band, The Mojo Ride, and their successful debut performance. They discuss music practice, audience response, and the joy of performing. Political topics, including Biden's potential candidacy, Trump's recent assassination attempt, and commentary on U.S. politics, dominate the latter part of the conversation, with mentions of Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, and the shifting political landscape. The script ends with a light-hearted note on going to an Irish pub and reminiscing about old bar stories.
