description: The hosts discuss a variety of topics, including a Michael Fassbender TV series and notable actors like Jeffrey Wright and Richard Gere. They delve into the mechanics of TV thrillers and banter-heavy scripts reminiscent of Aaron Sorkin's work. The conversation shifts to the intricacies of the Die Hard series, especially Die Hard 3 with Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson, and unexpected cultural references within it. They debate the challenges of musical adaptations like a contentious Joker film and recollect older musicals like La La Land. Dennis's fishing trip, Erik's dance party, and a tricky faucet repair involving mysterious tools. They end on a light note with a musical performance for their show and holiday cheer.
