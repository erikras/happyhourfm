## Summary

- **[00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=0)** Two friends catch up and discuss their week, which includes a backyard project involving building a deck for their father-in-law's wheelchair, which grew in size due to scope creep. They joke about the phallic nature of the deck and the importance of seizing the opportunity to make something bigger when the tools are out and the materials are already purchased. They end by discussing the idea of scope creep and how to navigate it.
- **[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=300)** The hosts of the podcast discuss potential t-shirt designs and slogans based on the term "scope creep." They consider various ideas, including a stick figure looking at windows, a less than/greater than symbol with a confused stick figure, and a stick figure with an erection peering into a window. They eventually settle on a simpler design with a stick figure peering into a square window on the back of the shirt and the definition of "scope creep" on the front. They then transition to discussing one of the host's experiences building a deck.
- **[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=600)** Dennis describes how he built a deck and extended the platform of the deck so that it would prevent someone in a wheelchair from falling down the stairs. He did all of this using scrap wood. He reveals that one of his goals was to minimize how much lumber he cut, as he didn't have much time. Furthermore, he mentions that he also needed to consider what wood was strong enough and what could look weaker. When he cut the boards, he ended up with a stack of 8 pieces of scrap, which he thought he wouldn't be able to use. He then realized he could use the leftover two by ten lying in his garage, and he assembled it to create the perfect distance between the two two-by-tens that the scrap of wood could fill in.
- **[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=900)** Dennis and Erik joke around and come up with onomatopoetic tools, emphasizing the importance of proper pronunciation. They then discuss Dennis's home improvement project and the challenges he faced in matching the railing to the deck. They also touch on his flourishing lawn and plants. Dennis shares his interaction with a neighbor who has been asking for advice on lawn care, to which Dennis jokingly advises him that "less is more."
- **[00:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=1200)** The hosts are discussing onomatopoetic tools and coming up with names for new tools. They mention tools such as the post oh dear, fresh paint brush, ladder, and pry bar, among others. They also talk about the television show Barry and how some characters, including Barry, were killed off in the final season. However, they express disappointment that there will not be a spin-off for some of the other characters, such as Fuchs, despite the potential for interesting storylines.
- **[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=1500)** The hosts of the podcast discuss a violent shootout scene from the final episode of a show. Barry's father had been killed, and Fuchs came to NoHo with some men to somehow have control of his riches and industry. Fuchs had four black SUVs full of bad dudes to get leverage. He had the goods on NoHo because he knew he killed Cristobal, and he wanted NoHo to admit it. NoHo broke down and eventually got shot by Fuchs. At the very end, a guy that was dying pulled out a grenade and threw it over at the three men still standing, blowing up and causing one guy's foot to fly off. Fuchs lay down on top of Barry's kid during the shootout.
- **[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=1800)** The conversation centers around the longevity of the podcast, with the hosts finding it hard to believe that they have produced 185 episodes. They also discuss the character Barry and the evolution of his emotional state, particularly in the scene where he prays for redemption in the car, before the discussion shifts to the surprising murder of his killer by Gene, who had been given the gun by Rip Torn as a gag gift. The hosts note the similarity between the way Barry's death was carried out and the way he had killed others in the past.
- **[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=2100)** The conversation moves from discussing a specific episode of a show to discussing the character development of various characters in the show, all of whom are being described as despicable. The hosts discuss some of the defining moments of certain characters, such as the deterioration of Sally's moral fiber and the sudden reveal that the six-year-old Barry's mother was feeding him alcohol to shut him up. Despite their personal moral failings, the hosts find humor in the physical comedy of Barry walking through a Walmart to get guns.
- **[00:40:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=2400)** The hosts discuss Bill Hader and his potential future projects after the end of his show, "Barry". They mention his comedic talent and his ability to imitate Arnold Schwarzenegger perfectly. The speakers note that Hader has many doors open to him, including the possibility of directing and acting in films. They also mention the way Hader talks about his fellow cast and crew members and appreciate his genuine appreciation for others' work. They end the section discussing a Conan O'Brien podcast and how Conan sounds like an average person talking, just like them.
- **[00:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=2700)** The hosts of the podcast engage in small talk about their drinking schedules and how Wednesday is a special night for going out in the middle of the week. They also discuss the effectiveness of commercials in advertising products, with one host expressing displeasure at a dandruff commercial that he found to be gross. The conversation then shifts to ads about hemorrhoid medicine and a supposed trick involving using it to reduce puffiness under the eyes.
- **[00:50:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=3000)** The speakers engage in casual banter and exchange jokes before discussing gardening and produce. They share stories of gardening experiences, including one in which the speaker waited three years for asparagus to sprout and ate it on the day it first appeared. In the end, the conversation turns to whether or not salt would be good for the Earth, with one speaker observing that their Earth is already 'bland', and wouldn't benefit from salt.
- **[00:55:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=3300)** The hosts sing a rendition of "Aquarius" and discuss a small plant that was found in one of their flower beds. The plant, which was not originally meant to be there, was nurtured and cared for, leading to its growth and development. The hosts also discuss a grass project they had for their children. During the conversation, they discuss how many stomachs a cow has, with one host mistakenly thinking it was two instead of four.
- **[01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=3600)** The conversation shifts to discussing onomatopoetic words and their uses. The example of the word "cud" is explored and it's pointed out that it's most commonly used when talking about ruminant animals, especially cows. The discussion then shifts to a story about a dive bar called The Sugar Bowl, where the narrator witnessed the band playing for a heavily intoxicated crowd. Finally, the conversation shifts to a gig played by a three-man band that creatively mixes genres, including Motown and Led Zeppelin, and pays homage to them in a unique way.
- **[01:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhsD38aZmW4&t=3900)** The hosts of the podcast brainstorm different onomatopoetic tools, ultimately deciding on the sound of a ratchet, which they suggest they could patent and make millions from. They joke about turning it into a market for toddler books with animal sounds. Later in the video, they discuss TV shows and movies they have watched and finish the episode by singing "Aquarius". They also suggest watching the video on Patreon to see all of the gestures and antics that Dennis was doing throughout the episode.
