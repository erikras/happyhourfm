## Summary

The broken globe on the lamp fell and cut his wrist, causing a 4-inch gash near the bone and tendon. Despite gushing blood, Dennis managed to quickly get help from his daughter who twisted a cloth into a tourniquet and rushed him to the hospital. He underwent a painful examination and operation to repair his tendons and was left with a plastic brace to aid in the healing process.
