description: The hosts discuss how Erik went to visit some ancient cave paintings, had lunch with some friends from Madrid, and then went for a hike on a Roman road, Dennis heard a horrible open mic guitar guy, sweeps his steps with a six foot broom, makes manure tea, deep throats asparagus, Erik's mailbox is a time machine, and touched baby rabbits.
