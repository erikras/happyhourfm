description: The hosts discuss Dennis' snowy December birthday, his snow-shoveling adventures, and a malfunctioning hot tub. They reminisce about previous conversations, including a lost recording of Erik's trip to New York where he visited the Comedy Cellar and learned a life lesson about taking the less traveled path. They also talk about Erik's trip to London for work, staying in a cramped hotel, and exploring the city. Dennis shares his experiences with flight delays and layovers, while both host discuss various lounges, bars, and restaurants they've visited during travels. The script ends with light-hearted banter, including a sing-along by Dennis.
