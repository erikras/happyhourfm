description: The hosts discuss how the Green Bay Packers fans co-own the team, Erik went to Greece and had travel woes, had to spend an early morning alone on the streets of Athens, flew home in Business Class, and enjoyed amazing Greek food; Dennis mocked someone ignoring a talk he gave once; Erik had some ouzo and swam in the Aegean Sea, and Dennis lost his good friend, Roger Przybylski.
