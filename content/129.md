  > Among the questions I sought to answer: How strong is each of these lines? That is, each is rated as “30-pound” test, but in fact, almost none break at that claimed strength. In fact, as the results show, one 30-pound line broke as high as 66.8 pounds. All but a few lines exceeded 30 pounds, though some broke at less than 27 pounds.
