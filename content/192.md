## Summary

- **[00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=0)** In this section, the hosts discuss their recent hiatus and the fun activities they engaged in during that time. They went to see a band called Out of Favor Boys and had a weekend of excessive drinking and enjoyment. They also organized an event that was well attended and had an after party with live music. The host's brother also visited, leading to an impromptu family gathering and a trip to a local Spanish fast food restaurant. They also briefly mention some issues that occurred on the other host's end, including a Spanish election and a vacation in a landlocked town.
- **[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=300)** In this section, the speaker talks about a small town that experiences a significant increase in population during the summer festival. Many people who had to move away for work return to the town for this event. The speaker describes how the bars, which are normally closed, come back to life during the festival. They also mention the lack of amenities, like a sofa and TV, in the house they stay in during their visit. However, they appreciate the air conditioning, especially during the hot siesta hours. The speaker also mentions the presence of their family and in-laws during their stay in the town, where they enjoy the experience of being unplugged and having meals prepared for them.
- **[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=600)** In this section, the speaker discusses their experience visiting a town in Spain that was a bit boring and filled with conversations about family members.

The conversation also touches on the topic of Spanish bands and music, with the speaker mentioning they used to be more into it but haven't discovered any new bands recently.

- **[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=900)** In this section, the speaker shares their experience of visiting their father-in-law's hometown, which is known for its production of charcoal. They explain that charcoal is made by burning wood and extinguishing it, resulting in slightly burnt wood. However, the process creates a significant amount of smoke, making it difficult to breathe and causing potential health concerns. Despite the discomfort, the speaker chose to endure the heat rather than open the window and let the smoky air in. They also mention the use of masks due to COVID-19 and the potential health risks associated with living in such an environment. Overall, the speaker emphasizes the challenging living conditions in this charcoal-producing town.
- **[00:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=1200)** In this section, the speaker shares a story about attending an impromptu music event at a man's house that he had met previously. The event was a fundraiser for a guitarist in need, and despite being the only ones in attendance, the guitarist and another musician gave exceptional performances. The host had set up a stage, lights, and a sound system to record the music. The speaker also mentions the delicious food that was cooked by the host's woman, who had been preparing for people to show up.

- **[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=1500)** In this section, the speaker reflects on their experience helping out a fellow musician and his family, feeding their children and enjoying the music together. They mention that their contribution far surpassed what others would have done, showing their willingness to lend a helping hand. They also mention jamming with other musicians at a festival and how musicians often come together to form bands and networks. The speaker shares their admiration for the music scene and the sense of community it brings. They also discuss the festival they attended, highlighting the late-night activities due to the intense daytime heat. Overall, it was a memorable and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
- **[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=1800)** In this section, the speaker talks about two unrelated topics: the lack of dancing at a certain event and a strange sighting in the sky. They mention that their wife was disappointed by the reduced amount of dancing at the event. Then, they discuss a memorable experience of seeing a line of bright lights moving across the sky, assuming it was a UFO sighting at first. However, they later found out that it was actually a Starlink train, a common occurrence caused by SpaceX satellites. The speaker reflects on the irony of asking for help on Twitter only to discover a mundane explanation for the phenomenon.
- **[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=2100)** In this section, the speaker discusses Elon Musk's success in launching satellites for his Starlink service. Musk is able to launch a large number of satellites every couple of weeks, allowing for satellite internet access in remote areas. This service became especially crucial during the war in Ukraine, as it provided communication when Russia cut off internet access. The speaker also mentions how Musk's eccentricity and innovative thinking have driven his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, to create groundbreaking advancements. However, there are still limitations imposed by physics that prevent certain ideas from being implemented, such as rockets doing loop-de-loops.
- **[00:40:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=2400)** In this section, the conversation shifts to discussions about other billionaires in the space industry, including Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos. They then mention Elon Musk challenging Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, with Musk jokingly tweeting about the idea. The host finds this amusing and compares it to how certain individuals, like Musk, are able to generate buzz and remain in the public eye by sharing random and entertaining stories. The topic then transitions to a story shared by the host's brother, who narrowly avoided a dangerous situation while working in an underground cylinder.
- **[00:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=2700)** In this section, the speaker reflects on a past incident involving a gas canister going underneath a ladder without knocking it over, expressing amazement at the outcome. They also mention the passing of someone named Lizard and briefly discuss current events, including their anticipation for a debate in which they predict Chris Christie will outshine other candidates and kill DeSantis's campaign. The speaker suggests that the debate should focus on policy rather than Trump, particularly emphasizing immigration as a key issue. They criticize DeSantis for being unlikable and poorly managed, referencing leaked memos about his campaign strategy. The speaker recalls Chris Christie's ability to take down opponents in debates, highlighting his knack for straightforwardness. Overall, they anticipate some lively exchanges during the upcoming debate.
- **[00:50:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=3000)** In this section, the speaker discusses Trump's debating skills and suggests that the other candidates are auditioning for the role of VP under Trump. They highlight the chaotic and dangerous situation of the current political landscape. The conversation then transitions to talking about past incumbents who have been primaried, mentioning Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy.

They also mention their own UFO sighting and express a preference for psychological horror over alien or serial killer genres. The conversation then shifts to a TV series about a 12-year-old vampire and her father who kills to give her the blood she needs. The speaker tries to convince the listener to watch the series but the listener doesn't seem interested in vampire-related content. The conversation then takes a light-hearted turn as the speaker sings a cowboy tune and hints at the title based on the opening lyrics.
- **[01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvfOTgxA8c&t=3600)** In this section, the host mentions two possible titles for an album, one being "I'm so miserable without you it's like you never left" and the other being "I want to meet you in the cornfield and kiss you between your ears". The host also expresses their enthusiasm for their new microphone and wraps up the episode, directing listeners to the show notes and to support them on Patreon.
