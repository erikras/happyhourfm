## Richland

We fought like tigers every day.
Each day's tides changed and stoked the fray.
I hated you, but hate me worse.
My love for you is such a curse.

Since you left, it's lonely misery.
I hold your picture, tears out the heart of me.
My love for you is such a curse.
I hate myself, even worse.

I'm so miserable since you're gone.
It's almost like you never left.
I'd have you back, if you'd have me.
I'll bring the gloves, you bring the repartee.

We'll fight like hell, then make sweet love.
It's so worse than now,
Than what we'll be is such a curse.
I'll hate myself, even worse.

I'm so miserable since you're gone.
It's almost like you never left.
I'll have you back, if you'd have me.
I'll bring the gloves, you bring the repartee.

I'm higher than a doctor's bill.
I've not paid them. And never will.
The cuts and scrapes and battle marks
Are the price I paid for our painful spark.

So please come back to my bruised arms.
It won't be good. It's just a step up.
I promise you this. My true love.
I'm so miserable since you're gone.

I'd have you back, if you'd have me.
I'll bring the gloves, you bring the repartee.
I'm so miserable, since you're gone.
It's almost like you never left.
