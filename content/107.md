> It was nineteen hundred and nineteen;
> Men and women were dying,
> With the stuff that the doctor called the flu.
> People were dying everywhere,
> Death was creepin' all through the air,
> And the groans of the rich sure was sad.
>
> (CHORUS:)
> Well it was God's almight plan,
> He was judging this old land,
> North and south, east and west,
> It can be seen,
> It killed the rich, killed the poor,
> It's gonna kill just a little more,
> If you don't turn away from the shame.
>
> Down in Memphis, Tennessee,
> The doctor said it soon would be,
> In a few days influenza would be controlled.
> Doctor sure man he got had,
> Sent the doctors all home to bed,
> And the nurses all broke out with the same.
> This song was originally posted on protestsonglyrics.net
> (CHORUS)

> Influenza is the kind of disease,
> Makes you weak down to your knees,
> Carries a fever everybody surely dreads,
> Packs a pain in every bone,
> In a few days, you are gone.
> To that hole in the ground called your grave.

> (CHORUS)
