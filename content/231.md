description: The hosts discuss recent personal health issues, including a painful throat infection treated with steroids. They recount travel experiences, Erik sharing a work trip to North Macedonia, detailing the food and lodging. There's a humorous exchange about perceptions of age and looks in actors from the Beetlejuice sequel. The hosts also delve into their entertainment preferences, reviewing Beetlejuice, McMurtry's novels, whiskey tasting, and a series called The Old Man. Their conversation ends with a brief mention of an odd Sasquatch movie and a nostalgic reference to Richard Harris' song, 'MacArthur Park'.
