description: The hosts discuss a complex fence-building project, complete with the challenges faced such as dealing with roots and using different tools like two-man augers and a special metal post holder. The conversation delves into the significance of certain dates, the effects of insomnia, and the capacity to remember details from past experiences, notably TV shows like Six Feet Under. There are also humorous reflections on movies like The Sixth Sense and the nature of entertainment. The discussion then transitions into a critique of the modern dependency on technology, particularly smartphones, in schools, and the implications for interpersonal interactions. The episode ends with musical reminisces and plans for a high school reunion performance.
