description: The hosts discuss Dennis caught a shaker, almost died when fishing in Alaska, and again almost died while having a spiritual ceremony where his parents died, felt the exact spot where his father died, one amazing day of fishing hundreds of salmon, again almost died throwing chum to sharks, his piano man plays boogie woogie, Erik got six splinters removed from his hand, burned off his fingerprint, a dead Russian helicopter pilot found in Spain, Ukraine is losing territory, Congress fails on immigration policy, the Michigan primary, and a cover of Etta James' "I'd Rather Go Blind".
