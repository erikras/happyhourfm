description: The hosts discuss Erik's visit to a casino in Malta with his colleagues, which ended with him quickly losing 50 euros at a blackjack table. Dennis reminisces about a poker game in Tacoma, Washington, where he won big and then lost significantly. They touch on daily life, including Dennis' dedication to fixing his barn from squirrels and looking after his grandchildren. Shifting gears, the conversation covers U.S. political updates, including a recent Democratic sweep in off-term state and local elections, implications for the mid-terms, and criticisms of Trump's policies and actions. Future plans like Erik's upcoming travel to New York City and attending various shows provide a sense of anticipation and personal enjoyment.
