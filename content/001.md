## Summary

- **[00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=0)** In this section, the conversation starts with Erik talking about his family's hike up a mountain, which was challenging but rewarding with a gorgeous view of the ocean at the top. Dennis teases Erik about a red gash on his forehead but they don't elaborate on it. They discuss how long it took for Erik to finish the hike with his kids, around five hours, but it was slow going due to the steep terrain and having to help his children climb rocks. Erik mentions his watch's GPS tracking feature and how it was difficult to track his progress due to the steep incline. They then talk about Erik's kids and how it was easier to parent two siblings with another child from a different family, as it divided their attention. They briefly touch on the weather, with Erik mentioning it was nice and around 65 degrees Fahrenheit, while Dennis talks about a snowstorm in his area. They joke about the contrast between different regions' weather and Erik mentions that Florida is often associated with retired New Yorkers. The conversation ends on a casual note.
- **[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=300)** In this section, the speaker talks about going out to see Tony's band play and playing poker. He mentions miscounting his money multiple times and the banker, Dave, kindly pointing out his mistake. The speaker also shares a story about going through an audit and finding both under and over charges, only to be told that they don't count it when the person charges too little. Despite the frustrations, the speaker acknowledges that state employees often get a bad rap and that there are both hardworking and not-so-hardworking individuals in every field. They also mention a woman who described some of the employees as figuratively and literally asleep at the wheel.
- **[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=600)** In this section, the conversation starts with a discussion about how to handle employees who are asleep on the job. The speaker suggests treating them with respect and not disturbing them, while focusing on working with the motivated employees. The conversation then shifts to a cousin who does art shows and sells unique pieces, including a Catholic-themed piece. They also mention an incident where a woman in Spain attempted to fix a painting in a church but ended up damaging it.
- **[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=900)** In this section, the hosts of "Happy Hour" discuss a viral news story that shows a woman accidentally painting a church wall. They find it hilarious and point out that while the incident gained worldwide attention, the woman's name is often forgotten. They then shift the conversation to tech support and briefly talk about a serious mistake someone could make, such as leaving a child in a car all day. They conclude that sometimes the social consequences and guilt that people face are punishment enough, making additional punishment redundant. The hosts also joke about dressing up as the woman for Halloween and bring up Monty Python's "Life of Brian" as a parody of religion.
- **[00:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=1200)** In this section, the discussion revolves around a cast of Monty Python and some vicars who were upset by the film "Life of Brian," which they believed was disrespectful. The cast of Monty Python school the clergy in their response, explaining that the movie is a satire about people who believed someone was the Messiah. The conversation then shifts to the term "corpsing," which refers to actors breaking into laughter while filming. The example given is a Monty Python skit where two men exaggerate their childhood hardships, resulting in a humorous exchange. The idea of performing Monty Python skits is brought up, but copyright issues are mentioned. The section ends with a comical reference to Schrodinger's cat and a discussion about a "dead" parrot sketch.
- **[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=1500)** In this section, the conversation takes a humorous turn as the topic shifts to "hilarious Jesus" and his possible comedy career. The hosts joke about Jesus doing stand-up and share funny scenarios involving him and his twin brother. They also bring up the concept of an unofficial Bible that may include stories about spider monkeys. The phrase "like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs" is mentioned, with origins traced back to Jesus. The hosts find the absurdity of the phrase amusing, although one of them still doesn't fully understand it.
- **[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=1800)** In this section, the conversation between the individuals revolves around random topics such as animal sounds, different names for fathers, and humorous anecdotes. They discuss a line from a movie that can be used with old people, but it takes a comical turn when one of them describes their mother-in-law's eccentric behavior. The conversation ends with a mention of getting another beer and promoting the podcast through social media.
- **[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l1CyonNV7So&t=2100)** In the final section the host asks viewers to email their thoughts to happy hour dot fm @ gmail.com and suggests giving a positive rating on iTunes or other podcast platforms. The host also mentions that the next episode will be released next week.
